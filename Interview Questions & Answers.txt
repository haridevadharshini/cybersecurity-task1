Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is an open port?
An open port is a network port that accepts incoming connections from other devices. Each open port is typically associated with a specific service or application running on the device.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
A TCP SYN scan (half-open scan) works by:

Sending a SYN packet to the target port

If the port is open, the target responds with SYN-ACK

Nmap immediately sends a RST (reset) packet to tear down the connection

If the port is closed, the target responds with RST
This method is stealthier than a full TCP connection scan.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
Risks include:

Potential entry points for attackers

Exposure of vulnerable services

Unauthorized access to systems

Information leakage about running services

Increased attack surface

4. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.

TCP scanning (like SYN scan) works with connection-oriented protocols where handshakes occur. UDP scanning is different because:

UDP is connectionless

No handshake occurs

Nmap sends UDP packets and interprets responses (or lack thereof)

Closed UDP ports often return ICMP port unreachable errors

Open UDP ports typically don't respond

5. How can open ports be secured?
Methods to secure open ports:

Close unnecessary ports

Use firewalls to restrict access

Implement strong authentication

Keep services updated

Use VPNs for remote access

Implement port knocking

Use intrusion detection/prevention systems

6. What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
A firewall:

Controls incoming/outgoing network traffic

Blocks or allows traffic based on port numbers

Can restrict access to specific IP addresses

Provides network segmentation

Logs connection attempts

Can detect and prevent port scanning

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
A port scan is a method to determine which ports are open on a network device. Attackers use it to:

Identify potential entry points

Discover running services

Find vulnerable versions of software

Map network topology

Plan attacks based on exposed services

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Wireshark complements port scanning by:

Providing packet-level visibility of scan traffic

Showing exact packet contents and timing

Revealing how targets respond to different scan types

Helping understand network behavior during scans

Debugging scan issues

Analyzing potential IDS/IPS responses
